* @Test
* Test Plan:
* 1. Test if the server is responding to GET requests at the root endpoint ("/").
* 2. Test if the response of the GET request is an HTML file.
* 3. Test if the HTML file returned is the correct file, i.e., "index.html".
* 4. Test if the server is handling any errors that may occur during the sending of the HTML file.
* 5. Test if the error is being logged in the console if an error occurs.
Test Results:
* 1.Test for GET request at root endpoint ("/"):
    a. Use a testing framework (e.g., Mocha, Jest) to create a test suite for the server.
    b. Use a testing framework to create a test case that sends a GET request to the root endpoint.
    c. Verify that the response status code is 200, indicating that the request was successful. 
* 2. Test for GET request at root endpoint ("/"):

    b. Verify that the HTML file returned is "index.html".
* 5. Test for error logging:
    a. Use a testing framework to create a test case that sends a GET request to the root endpoint with an invalid file path.
    b. Verify that the error message is logged in the console.

* @Test
* Test Plan:
* 1. Manually run the code and verify that the server is listening on port 3000.
* 2. Check that the console message "Server is listening on port 3000" is displayed in the console when the server is started.
* 3. Check that the server can receive requests on port 3000 and respond appropriately.
* 4. Try to start the server on a different port number (e.g., 4000) and verify that the console message reflects the new port number.
* 5. Try to start the server on a port number that is already in use and verify that the server fails to start.
Test Results:
* 1. If the server is listening on port 3000 and no errors occur, mark the test as passed.
* 2. If the console message "Server is listening on port 3000" is displayed when the server is started, mark the test as passed.
* 3. If the server can receive requests on port 3000 and respond appropriately, mark the test as passed.

* 5. If the server fails to start on a port number that is already in use, mark the test as passed.
